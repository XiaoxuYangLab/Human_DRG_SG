## Permutation analysis to simulate the probability distribution of branches according to single-cell expression and genotyping analysis

The codes for permutation from number of cells assuming random distribution could be found [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/blob/main/Analysis/Permutation_single_cell/Permutation.sh)

After summarizing the result, distribution of 10,000 permutations for all 224 cells compared with observations is show [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/blob/main/Analysis/Permutation_single_cell/Plot_224_permutation.R). And 75 cell-type resolved conditions is permutated [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/blob/main/Analysis/Permutation_ingle_cell/Plot_75_permutation.R).
