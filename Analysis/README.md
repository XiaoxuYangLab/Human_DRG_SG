# Data analysis

## Visualize the allelic fractions among tissue samples with geoclones

"geoclones" are used to map the AF of each candidate mosaic variant onto the schematic of the body plan, geoclones of the three donors were generated from a code [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/tree/main/Analysis/geoclone).

## Estimation of variances within the ganglia chain vertically and between ganglia in the horizontal levels

Estimation of AF standard deviation within and between ganglia chains can be found [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/tree/main/Analysis/Stdev_vertical_horizontal)

## Estimation of starting cell populations

Starting cell population when DRG/SG split and Left/Right split are estimated [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/tree/main/Analysis/Simulate_starting_population).

## Single-nuclei DNA and RNA sequencing permutations

For snMPAS and ResolveOME analysis, permutation analysis is described [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/tree/main/Analysis/Permutation_single_cell).
