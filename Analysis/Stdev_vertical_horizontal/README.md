# Similarity of variants in vertical and horizontal groups
To compare the overall similarity of vertical (rostral-caudal ganglia chain levels) groups vs horizontal groups (DRG-SG at the adjacent levels), the standard deviation between vertical groups (DRG L, SG L, DRG R, SG R) in the thoracic levels are calculated for each non-het mosaic variant, compared with the standard deviation of the adjacent groups (T1, T2, and T3 DRG SG L R for example).
