# Plot for geoclones

A geoclone is the schematic that we use to show the different allelic fractions of the mosaic variants in the original body plan. The shade of red represents the fractions of mutant alleles.

THe codes used to plot the geoclone can be found [here](https://github.com/shishenyxx/Human_DRG_SG/blob/main/Analysis/geoclone/geoclone.r).
